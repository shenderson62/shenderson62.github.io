Hello! I am a recent graduate from the Georgia Institute of Technology. In May 2024, I earned a Master’s in Computer Science, specializing in Machine Learning. In May 2023, I graduated with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science, concentrating in Intelligence and Information Internetworks. Currently, I work as a Software Engineer within the Storage and Retrieval Strategy (SRS) Team at [Symbotic](https://www.symbotic.com/), centered on automating warehouse robots. Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Microsoft and Slalom Build, and held Teaching Assistant and Research Assistant positions at the Georgia Tech College of Computing.
